Java Snake Game

The Java Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using the Java Swing framework. The objective of the game is to control a snake to eat apples while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. Each apple the snake eats increases its length and the player's score. The game continues until the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.

 Key Features:
 Game Window: The game is displayed in a window with a gridlike play area where the snake moves and apples appear.
 Snake Movement: The snake can be controlled using the arrow keys, allowing it to move up, down, left, or right.
 Apple Generation: Apples appear at random positions on the grid, and each time the snake eats an apple, it grows longer.
 Collision Detection: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
 Score Tracking: The player's score increases with each apple eaten, and the score is displayed on the game over screen.
 Game Loop: The game uses a timer to create a game loop, which updates the snake's position and checks for collisions at regular intervals.

 Implementation Details:
 Java Swing: Used for creating the game window and handling user input.
 AWT: Utilized for rendering graphics and handling game events.
 Timer: Manages the game loop, ensuring smooth and consistent updates to the game's state.
 Random: Used for generating random positions for the apples.

This implementation provides an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience, showcasing the use of fundamental Java programming concepts and objectoriented principles. It is an excellent project for learning and demonstrating skills in Java, Swing, and basic game development.
